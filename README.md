# My Personal Project

## ***Budget Tracker***


1. 
-   The application allows to track an individuals cash flow statements by accounting for their income and expenses.
-   This would help individual budget their expenditures and see how much they have, hence preventing them from overspending. 
-   It would provide an easy-to-use platform to monitor their financial transactions. 

2.
- Any individual wishing to track their expenditures and financial transaction could use this. 
- Normally people who are earning and want to monitor their expenses.

3. 
- Finance is something I am interested in and figuring out a way to include that in my project would make it 
more enjoyable through the term.
- This project has scope to grow as my skill set grows, hence, I could continue improving this project even after 
the course is done
